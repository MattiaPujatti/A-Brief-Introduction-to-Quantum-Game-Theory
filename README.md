# A-Brief-Introduction-to-Quantum-Game-Theory

In view of my exam of Game Theory (master degree in Physics of Data, Universit√† degli studi di Padova, a.y. 2020-21) I have developed this small project in order to show how the (relatively) recent developments in quantum information have affected also the way in which game theory problems are solved.
In particular, this repository contains a summary paper, that I had to submit, mainly focused on the birth of quantum game theory and on the formalism developed to reformulate 2 x 2 games (usually static and of complete information); then the article goes with a deeper analysis of two canonical problems from a quantistic point of view:
* Prisoners' Dilemma
* Battle of Sexes
providing also new interesting solutions that are absent in their classical counterpart.

The paper is inteded for people with basically no background in quantum information theory (there is also a small appendix to remark some concepts) and just a few knowledge of quantum mechanics. For this reason, people that already have it may found it a bit dispersive: I apologize, but I had some standards to respect.
