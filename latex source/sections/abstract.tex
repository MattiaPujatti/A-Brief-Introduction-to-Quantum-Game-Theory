\textbf{Abstract}\\
In this report will be summarized the recent developments in quantum information that pushed scientists to apply the rules of quantum mechanics also to game theoretical problems. It will be provided also the step-by-step reformulation of such games in a quantum world, together with the redefinition of other game theory's concepts. In the end, two canonical examples, the Prisoners' Dilemma and the Battle of Sexes, will be analyzed and simulated in order to prove the advantages brought by the quantum moves and the new interesting equilibria of such games.\\
