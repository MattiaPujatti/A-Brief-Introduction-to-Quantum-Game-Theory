\section{Measures ?}

The first main difference between this game and its classical counterpart lies in the fact that this time you are dealing with a quantum system, and a quantum system cannot be observed, i.e. measured, without completely destroying it: basically, this state is not just "only spin-up" or "only spin-down" depending on the stage of the game and on the strategies chosen, but at any time it can be any possible superposition of the two eigenstates up and down like
\[ \psi = a\ket{\uparrow} + b\ket{\downarrow} \qquad \abs{a}^2 + \abs{b}^2 = 1, \quad a,b\in\mathds{C}\]
Measuring $\ket{\psi}$, you ends up in projecting it into $\ket{\uparrow}$ or $\ket{\downarrow}$
with probabilities $\abs{a}^2$ and $\abs{b}^2$ respectively, but without \\
